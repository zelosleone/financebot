## 🏠 Development Mode Guide

### What is Development Mode?

Development mode provides a complete local development environment without any external dependencies beyond the core APIs (Valyu, Daytona). It's perfect for:

- **Local Development** - No hosted database setup required
- **Offline Work** - All data stored locally in SQLite
- **Testing Features** - Unlimited queries without billing
- **Privacy** - Use local Ollama models, no cloud LLM needed
- **Quick Prototyping** - No authentication or rate limits

### How It Works

When `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE=development`:

1. **Local SQLite Database** (`/.local-data/dev.db`)
   - Automatically created on first run
   - Stores chat sessions, messages, charts, and CSVs
   - Full schema for chat sessions, messages, charts, and CSVs
   - Easy to inspect with `sqlite3 .local-data/dev.db`

2. **Mock Authentication**
   - Auto-login as dev user (`dev@localhost`)
   - No sign-up/sign-in required
   - Unlimited tier access with all features

3. **No Rate Limits**
   - Unlimited chat queries
   - No usage tracking
   - No billing integration

4. **LLM Selection**
   - **Ollama models** (if installed) - Used first, unlimited and free
   - **LM Studio models** (if installed) - Alternative local option with GUI
   - **OpenAI** (if API key provided) - Fallback if no local models available
   - See local models indicator in top-right corner with provider switching

### Choosing Between Ollama and LM Studio

Finance supports both **Ollama** and **LM Studio** for running local LLMs. Both are free, private, and work offline - choose based on your preferences:

**🦙 Ollama** - Best for developers and terminal users
- ✅ Lightweight and fast
- ✅ Simple CLI commands
- ✅ Automatic model management
- ✅ Great for headless servers
- ✅ Lower resource usage
- ❌ Less visual feedback
- ❌ No built-in GPU monitoring

**🎨 LM Studio** - Best for visual users and beginners
- ✅ Beautiful GUI with model browser
- ✅ Real-time GPU/CPU monitoring
- ✅ Easy model downloading and management
- ✅ Visual server status and controls
- ✅ Built-in prompt testing
- ❌ Slightly more resource intensive
- ❌ GUI required (not headless)

**💡 You can use both!** Finance detects both automatically and lets you switch between them with a provider selector in the UI.

### Setting Up Ollama

Ollama provides unlimited, private LLM inference on your local machine - completely free and runs offline!

**🚀 Quick Setup (No Terminal Required):**

1. **Download Ollama App**
   - Visit [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and download the app for your OS
   - Install and open the Ollama app
   - It runs in your menu bar (macOS) or system tray (Windows/Linux)

2. **Download a Model**
   - Open Ollama app and browse available models
   - Download `qwen2.5:7b` (recommended - best for Finance features)
   - Or choose from: `llama3.1`, `mistral`, `deepseek-r1`
   - That's it! Finance will automatically detect and use it

3. **Use in Finance**
   - Start Finance in development mode
   - Ollama status indicator appears in top-right corner
   - Shows your available models
   - Click to select which model to use
   - Icons show capabilities: 🔧 (tools) and 🧠 (reasoning)

**⚡ Advanced Setup (Terminal):**

If you prefer using the terminal:

```bash
# Install Ollama
brew install ollama              # macOS
# OR
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh  # Linux

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# Download recommended models
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b          # Recommended - excellent tool support
ollama pull llama3.1:8b         # Alternative - good performance
ollama pull mistral:7b          # Alternative - fast
ollama pull deepseek-r1:7b      # For reasoning/thinking mode
```

**💡 It Just Works:**
- Finance automatically detects Ollama when it's running
- No configuration needed
- Automatically falls back to OpenAI if Ollama is unavailable
- Switch between models anytime via the local models popup

### Setting Up LM Studio (Alternative)

LM Studio provides a beautiful GUI for running local LLMs - perfect if you prefer visual interfaces over terminal commands!

**🎨 Easy Setup with GUI:**

1. **Download LM Studio**
   - Visit [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai) and download for your OS
   - Install and open LM Studio
   - The app provides a full GUI for managing models

2. **Download Models**
   - Click on the 🔍 Search icon in LM Studio
   - Browse available models or search for:
     - `qwen/qwen3-14b` (recommended - excellent tool support)
     - `openai/gpt-oss-20b` (OpenAI's open source model with reasoning)
     - `google/gemma-3-12b` (Google's model with good performance)
     - `qwen/qwen3-4b-thinking-2507` (reasoning model)
   - Click download and wait for it to complete
   - Models are cached locally for offline use

3. **Start the Server**
   - Click the LM Studio logo in your macOS menu bar (top-right corner)
   - Select **"Start Server on Port 1234..."**

   ![LM Studio Start Server](public/lmstudio-start.png)

   - Server starts immediately - you'll see the status change to "Running"
   - That's it! Finance will automatically detect it

4. **Important: Configure Context Window**
   - ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This app uses extensive tool descriptions that require adequate context length
   - In LM Studio, when loading a model:
     - Click on the model settings (gear icon)
     - Set **Context Length** to **at least 8192 tokens** (16384+ recommended)
     - If you see errors like "tokens to keep is greater than context length", your context window is too small
   - Without sufficient context length, you'll get errors when the AI tries to use tools
   - This applies to all models in LM Studio - configure each model individually

5. **Use in Finance**
   - Start Finance in development mode
   - Local models indicator appears in top-right corner
   - If both Ollama and LM Studio are running, you'll see a provider switcher
   - Click to select which provider and model to use
   - Icons show capabilities: 🔧 (tools) and 🧠 (reasoning)

**⚙️ Configuration:**
- Default URL: `http://localhost:1234`
- Can be customized in `.env.local`:
  ```env
  LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234
  ```

**💡 LM Studio Features:**
- Real-time GPU/CPU usage monitoring
- Easy model comparison and testing
- Visual prompt builder
- Chat history within LM Studio
- No terminal commands needed

### Switching Between Providers

If you have both Ollama and LM Studio running, Finance automatically detects both and shows a beautiful provider switcher in the local models popup:

- **Visual Selection**: Click provider buttons with logos
- **Seamless Switching**: Switch between providers without reloading
- **Independent Models**: Each provider shows its own model list
- **Automatic Detection**: No manual configuration needed

The provider switcher appears automatically when multiple providers are detected!

### Model Capabilities

Not all models support all features. Here's what works:

**Tool Calling Support** (Execute Python, search web, create charts):
- ✅ qwen2.5, qwen3, deepseek-r1, deepseek-v3
- ✅ llama3.1, llama3.2, llama3.3
- ✅ mistral, mistral-nemo, mistral-small
- ✅ See full list in Ollama popup (wrench icon)

**Thinking/Reasoning Support** (Show reasoning steps):
- ✅ deepseek-r1, qwen3, magistral
- ✅ gpt-oss, cogito
- ✅ See full list in Ollama popup (brain icon)

**What happens if model lacks tool support?**
- You'll see a friendly dialog explaining limitations
- Can continue with text-only responses
- Or switch to a different model that supports tools

### Development Mode Features

✅ **Full Chat History**
- All conversations saved to local SQLite

```

**Reset Database:**
```bash
rm -rf .local-data/
# Database recreated on next app start
```

**Backup Database:**
```bash
cp -r .local-data/ .local-data-backup/
```

### Switching Between Modes

**Development → Production:**
1. Remove/comment `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE=development`
2. Add production environment variables
3. Restart server

**Production → Development:**
1. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE=development`
2. Restart server
3. Local database and browser cache automatically created

**Note:** Production and development data are stored separately. Switching modes doesn't migrate data.

### Troubleshooting Development Mode

**Sidebar won't open on homepage:**
- Fixed! Sidebar now respects dock setting even on homepage

**Local models not detected:**
- **Ollama**: Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
  - Check Ollama URL in `.env.local` (default: `http://localhost:11434`)
  - Verify models are installed: `ollama list`
- **LM Studio**: Click LM Studio menu bar icon → "Start Server on Port 1234..."
  - Check LM Studio URL in `.env.local` (default: `http://localhost:1234`)
  - Verify at least one model is downloaded in LM Studio
  - Server must be running for Finance to detect it

**Database errors:**
- Delete and recreate: `rm -rf .local-data/`
- Check file permissions in `.local-data/` directory

**Auth errors:**
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE=development` is set
- Clear browser localStorage and cache
- Restart dev server
